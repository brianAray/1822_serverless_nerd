|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automation Testing Overview**    | Understand the purpose and key benefits of automation testing. Be able to explain when and why automation is used. |
| **Automation Testing Best Practices** | Identify and describe key best practices in automation testing, such as maintainability, reliability, and scalability. |
| **Intro to Cypress for Automation Testing** | Explain what Cypress is, its advantages for front-end testing, and how it compares to other testing frameworks. |
| **Cypress Installation & Setup**   | Be able to install Cypress and configure it for basic use in a test environment.                               |
| **Cypress Commands Overview**      | Understand common Cypress commands (e.g., `.visit()`, `.get()`, `.click()`) and know when to use them.         |
| **Cypress Test Structure & Syntax** | Write basic Cypress test cases with correct structure and syntax, including `describe`, `it`, and `beforeEach` blocks. |
| **Selectors & Assertions**         | Use selectors (e.g., CSS, data attributes) to target elements and write simple assertions (e.g., `.should()`, `.expect()`). |

### Intermediate

|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cypress Test Suites**            | Organize test cases into logical test suites and understand how to group related tests for better maintainability. |
| **Cypress Test Cases**             | Develop multiple Cypress test cases with different scenarios, covering various user interactions on a web application. |
| **Interacting with Elements**      | Interact with various web elements, such as input fields, buttons, and dropdowns, using Cypress commands like `.type()`, `.select()`, `.click()`. |
| **Fixtures**                       | Use fixtures to store and manage test data, and incorporate this data into Cypress test cases for dynamic testing. |
| **Cypress Best Practices**         | Apply Cypress best practices, such as keeping tests independent, reducing flaky tests, and ensuring tests run efficiently. |

### Advanced

| Topic                             | Exit Criteria                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Selectors & Assertions**         | Write complex assertions (e.g., asserting on objects, arrays, and API responses) and use advanced selectors (e.g., custom commands). |
| **Cypress Best Practices**         | Optimize large-scale test suites, manage test data effectively, and incorporate Cypress into CI pipelines.      |
| **Fixtures**                       | Use advanced techniques for managing fixtures, such as dynamically loading data or using fixtures in multiple tests. |
