# Docker: Volume
Docker volumes are a special kind of directory that is managed by Docker and can be used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers, and are managed by Docker itself. Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts: for example, volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts, can be more safely shared among multiple containers, and can be managed using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API. In addition, volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, encrypt the contents of volumes, or add other functionality.

To make a volume you can use the docker CLI

```cli
docker volume create my_volume
```

Once you have your volume you can mount it to a container

```cli
docker run --mount source=my_volume,target=/data image_name
```

Now any data inside the "data" directory of the container made from "image_name" will be mounted in your volume called "my_volume"
